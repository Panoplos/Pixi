# Pi

Pi is a minimal, extensible AI agent for the terminal. Adapt Pi to your workflow, not the other way around.

Ask Pi to create the prompt templates, skills, extensions, and themes you need, or install a Pi package. Use Pi directly, automate it in print, JSON, or RPC mode, or build applications with the TypeScript SDK.

## Getting started

Install the command-line interface with npm:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

This requires Node.js 22.19 or newer. `--ignore-scripts` disables dependency lifecycle scripts during install. Pixi does not require install scripts for normal npm installs.

On macOS or Linux, you can instead use the installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panoplos/Pixi/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Start Pi in the directory where you want it to work:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
pixi
```

For a built-in AI provider, run `/login` inside Pi to connect a subscription or API key. Then give Pi a task.

See the [documentation](docs/index.md) for full setup and usage instructions.

## Development

Clone the repository, install its dependencies, and run Pi from source:

```bash
pixi
/login  # Then select provider
```

Then just talk to Pixi. By default, Pixi gives the model four tools: `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash`. The model uses these to fulfill your requests. Add capabilities via [skills](#skills), [prompt templates](#prompt-templates), [extensions](#extensions), or [pi packages](#pi-packages).

Before submitting changes, run:

```bash
npm run check
./test.sh
```
